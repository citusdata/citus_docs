Monitoring
##########

To monitor events in the life of a formation with outside tools via a standard format, we offer RSS feeds per organization. You can use a feed reader or RSS Slack integration (e.g. on an :code:`#ops` channel) to keep up to date.

On the upper right of the "Formations" list in the Cloud console, follow the "Formation Events" link to the RSS feed.

The feed includes entries for three types of events, each with the following details:

**Server Unavailable**

This is a notification of connectivity problems such as hardware failure.

*  Formation name
*  Formation url
*  Server

**Failover Scheduled**

For planned upgrades, or when operating a formation without high availability that experiences a failure, this event will appear to indicate a future planned failover event.

*  Formation name
*  Formation url
*  Leader
*  Failover at

For planned failovers, "failover at" will usually match your maintenance window. Note that the failover might happen at this point or shortly thereafter, once a follower is available and has caught up to the primary database.

**Failover**

Failovers happen to address hardware failure, as mentioned, and also for other reasons such as performing system software upgrades, or transferring data to a server with better hardware.

*  Formation name
*  Formation url
*  Leader
*  Situation
*  Follower
