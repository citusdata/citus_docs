Billing and pricing 
-------------------

Citus Cloud bills on a per minute basis. We bill for a minimum of 1 hour of usage across all plans. Pricing varies based on the size and configuration of the cluster. The four factors that determine your price are:

- Size of your primary node
- Size of your distributed nodes
