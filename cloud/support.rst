Billing

Pricing
-------

Citus Cloud bills on a per minute basis. We bill for a minimum of one hour of usage across all plans. Pricing varies based on the size and configuration of the cluster. A few factors that determine your price are:

- Size of your distributed nodes
- Number of distributed nodes
- Whether you have high availability enabled, both on the primary node and on distributed nodes
- Size of your primary node

You can see pricing of various configurations directly within our `pricing calculator <https://www.citusdata.com/pricing>`_.

Payments
--------

We accept payments through credit card or directly through bank ACH. To set up payment details, go to "Org" -> "Billing" in the main menu of the Cloud Console.
