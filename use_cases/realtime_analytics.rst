Real-Time Dashboards
====================

Citus provides real-time queries over large datasets. One workload we commonly see at
Citus involves powering real-time dashboards of event data.

For example, you could be a cloud services provider helping other businesses monitor their
HTTP traffic. Every time one of your clients receives an HTTP request your service
receives a log record. You want to ingest all those records and create an HTTP analytics
dashboard which gives your clients insights such as the number HTTP errors their sites
served. It's important that this data shows up with as little latency as possible so your
clients can fix problems with their sites. It's also important for the dashboard to show
graphs of historical trends.

Alternatively, maybe you're building an advertising network and want to show clients
clickthrough rates on their campaigns. In this example latency is also critical, raw data
volume is also high, and both historical and live data are important.

In this section we'll demonstrate how to build part of the first example, but this
architecture would work equally well for the second and many other use-cases.

Data Model
----------

The data we're dealing with is an immutable stream of log data. We'll insert directly into
Citus but it's also common for this data to first be routed through something like Kafka.
Doing so has the usual advantages, and makes it easier to pre-aggregate the data once data
volumes become unmanageably high.

We'll use a simple schema for ingesting HTTP event data. This schema serves as an example
to demonstrate the overall architecture; a real system might use additional columns.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- this is run on the coordinator

  CREATE TABLE http_request (
    site_id INT,
    ingest_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

    url TEXT,
    request_country TEXT,
    ip_address TEXT,

    status_code INT,
    response_time_msec INT
  );

  SELECT create_distributed_table('http_request', 'site_id');

When we call :ref:`create_distributed_table <create_distributed_table>`
we ask Citus to hash-distribute ``http_request`` using the ``site_id`` column. That means
all the data for a particular site will live in the same shard.

The UDF uses the default configuration values for shard count. We
recommend :ref:`using 2-4x as many shards <faq_choose_shard_count>` as
CPU cores in your cluster. Using this many shards lets you rebalance
data across your cluster after adding new worker nodes.

.. NOTE::

  Citus Cloud uses `streaming replication <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/warm-standby.html>`_ to achieve high availability and thus maintaining shard replicas would be redundant. In any production environment where streaming replication is unavailable, you should set ``citus.shard_replication_factor`` to 2 or higher for fault tolerance.

With this, the system is ready to accept data and serve queries! Keep the following loop running in a ``psql`` console in the background while you continue with the other commands in this article. It generates fake data every second or two.

.. code-block:: postgres

  DO $$
    BEGIN LOOP
      INSERT INTO http_request (
        site_id, ingest_time, url, request_country,
        ip_address, status_code, response_time_msec
      ) VALUES (
        trunc(random()*32), clock_timestamp(),
        concat('http://example.com/', md5(random()::text)),
        ('{China,India,USA,Indonesia}'::text[])[ceil(random()*4)],
        concat(
          trunc(random()*250 + 2), '.',
          trunc(random()*250 + 2), '.',
          trunc(random()*250 + 2), '.',
          trunc(random()*250 + 2)
        )::inet,
        ('{200,404}'::int[])[ceil(random()*2)],
        5+trunc(random()*150)
      );
      PERFORM pg_sleep(random() * 0.25);
    END LOOP;
  END $$;

Once you're ingesting data, you can run dashboard queries such as:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT
    site_id,
    date_trunc('minute', ingest_time) as minute,
    COUNT(1) AS request_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (status_code between 200 and 299) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (status_code between 200 and 299) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) as error_count,
    SUM(response_time_msec) / COUNT(1) AS average_response_time_msec
  FROM http_request
  WHERE date_trunc('minute', ingest_time) > now() - '5 minutes'::interval
  GROUP BY site_id, minute
  ORDER BY minute ASC;

The setup described above works, but has two drawbacks:

* Your HTTP analytics dashboard must go over each row every time it needs to generate a
  graph. For example, if your clients are interested in trends over the past year, your
  queries will aggregate every row for the past year from scratch.
* Your storage costs will grow proportionally with the ingest rate and the length of the
  queryable history. In practice, you may want to keep raw events for a shorter period of
  time (one month) and look at historical graphs over a longer time period (years).

Rollups
-------

You can overcome both drawbacks by rolling up the raw data into a pre-aggregated form.
Here, we'll aggregate the raw data into a table which stores summaries of 1-minute
intervals. In a production system, you would probably also want something like 1-hour and
1-day intervals, these each correspond to zoom-levels in the dashboard. When the user
wants request times for the last month the dashboard can simply read and chart the values
for each of the last 30 days.

.. code-block:: sql

  CREATE TABLE http_request_1min (
    site_id INT,
    ingest_time TIMESTAMPTZ, -- which minute this row represents

    error_count INT,
    success_count INT,
    request_count INT,
    average_response_time_msec INT,
    CHECK (request_count = error_count + success_count),
    CHECK (ingest_time = date_trunc('minute', ingest_time))
  );

  SELECT create_distributed_table('http_request_1min', 'site_id');

  CREATE INDEX http_request_1min_idx ON http_request_1min (site_id, ingest_time);

This looks a lot like the previous code block. Most importantly: It also shards on
``site_id`` and uses the same default configuration for shard count and
replication factor. Because all three of those match, there's a 1-to-1
correspondence between ``http_request`` shards and ``http_request_1min`` shards,
and Citus will place matching shards on the same worker. This is called
:ref:`co-location <colocation>`; it makes queries such as joins faster and our rollups possible.

.. image:: /images/colocation.png
  :alt: co-location in citus

In order to populate ``http_request_1min`` we're going to periodically run
an INSERT INTO SELECT. This is possible because the tables are co-located.
The following function wraps the rollup query up for convenience.

.. code-block:: plpgsql

  -- single-row table to store when we rolled up last
  CREATE TABLE latest_rollup (
    minute timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,

    -- "minute" should be no more precise than a minute
    CHECK (minute = date_trunc('minute', minute))
  );

  -- initialize to a time long ago
  INSERT INTO latest_rollup VALUES ('10-10-1901');

  -- function to do the rollup
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION rollup_http_request() RETURNS void AS $$
  DECLARE
    curr_rollup_time timestamptz := date_trunc('minute', now());
    last_rollup_time timestamptz := minute from latest_rollup;
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO http_request_1min (
      site_id, ingest_time, request_count,
      success_count, error_count, average_response_time_msec
    ) SELECT
      site_id,
      date_trunc('minute', ingest_time),
      COUNT(1) as request_count,
      SUM(CASE WHEN (status_code between 200 and 299) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_count,
      SUM(CASE WHEN (status_code between 200 and 299) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) as error_count,
      SUM(response_time_msec) / COUNT(1) AS average_response_time_msec
    FROM http_request
    -- roll up only data new since last_rollup_time
    WHERE date_trunc('minute', ingest_time) <@
            tstzrange(last_rollup_time, curr_rollup_time, '(]')
    GROUP BY 1, 2;

    -- update the value in latest_rollup so that next time we run the
    -- rollup it will operate on data newer than curr_rollup_time
    UPDATE latest_rollup SET minute = curr_rollup_time;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

.. note::

  The above function should be called every minute. You could do this by
  adding a crontab entry on the coordinator node:

  .. code-block:: bash

    * * * * * psql -c 'SELECT rollup_http_request();'

  Alternately, an extension such as `pg_cron <https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron>`_
  allows you to schedule recurring queries directly from the database.

The dashboard query from earlier is now a lot nicer:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT site_id, ingest_time as minute, request_count,
         success_count, error_count, average_response_time_msec
    FROM http_request_1min
   WHERE ingest_time > date_trunc('minute', now()) - '5 minutes'::interval;

Expiring Old Data
-----------------

The rollups make queries faster, but we still need to expire old data to avoid unbounded
storage costs. Simply decide how long you'd like to keep data for each granularity, and use standard queries to delete expired data. In the following example, we decided to
keep raw data for one day, and per-minute aggregations for one month:

.. code-block:: plpgsql

  DELETE FROM http_request WHERE ingest_time < now() - interval '1 day';
  DELETE FROM http_request_1min WHERE ingest_time < now() - interval '1 month';

In production you could wrap these queries in a function and call it every minute in a cron job.

Data expiration can go even faster by using table range partitioning on top of Citus hash distribution. See the :ref:`timeseries` section for a detailed example.

Those are the basics! We provided an architecture that ingests HTTP events and
then rolls up these events into their pre-aggregated form. This way, you can both store
raw events and also power your analytical dashboards with subsecond queries.


The next sections extend upon the basic architecture and show you how to resolve questions
which often appear.


Approximate Distinct Counts
---------------------------

A common question in HTTP analytics deals with :ref:`approximate distinct counts
<count_distinct>`: How many unique visitors visited your site over the last month?
Answering this question *exactly* requires storing the list of all previously-seen visitors
in the rollup tables, a prohibitively large amount of data. However an approximate answer
is much more manageable.

A datatype called hyperloglog, or HLL, can answer the query
approximately; it takes a surprisingly small amount of space to tell you
approximately how many unique elements are in a set. Its accuracy can be
adjusted. We'll use ones which, using only 1280 bytes, will be able to
count up to tens of billions of unique visitors with at most 2.2% error.

An equivalent problem appears if you want to run a global query, such as the number of
unique IP addresses which visited any of your client's sites over the last month. Without
HLLs this query involves shipping lists of IP addresses from the workers to the coordinator for
it to deduplicate. That's both a lot of network traffic and a lot of computation. By using
HLLs you can greatly improve query speed.

First you must install the HLL extension; `the github repo
<https://github.com/citusdata/postgresql-hll>`_ has instructions. Next, you have
to enable it:

.. code-block:: sql

  --------------------------------------------------------
  -- Run on all nodes ------------------------------------

  CREATE EXTENSION hll;

.. note::

  This is not necessary on Citus Cloud, which has HLL already installed,
  along with other useful :ref:`cloud_extensions`.

Now we're ready to track IP addresses in our rollup with HLL. First
add a column to the rollup table.

.. code-block:: sql

  ALTER TABLE http_request_1min ADD COLUMN distinct_ip_addresses hll;

Next use our custom aggregation to populate the column. Just add it
to the query in our rollup function:

.. code-block:: diff

    INSERT INTO http_request_1min (
      site_id, ingest_time, request_count,
      success_count, error_count, average_response_time_msec,
  +   distinct_ip_addresses
    ) SELECT
      site_id,
      minute,
      COUNT(1) as request_count,
      SUM(CASE WHEN (status_code between 200 and 299) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as success_count,
      SUM(CASE WHEN (status_code between 200 and 299) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) as error_count,

  +   hll_add_agg(hll_hash_text(ip_address)) AS distinct_ip_addresses
    FROM http_request

Dashboard queries are a little more complicated, you have to read out the distinct
number of IP addresses by calling the ``hll_cardinality`` function:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT site_id, ingest_time as minute, request_count,
         success_count, error_count, average_response_time_msec,
         hll_cardinality(distinct_ip_addresses) AS distinct_ip_address_count
    FROM http_request_1min
   WHERE ingest_time > date_trunc('minute', now()) - interval '5 minutes';

HLLs aren't just faster, they let you do things you couldn't previously. Say we did our
rollups, but instead of using HLLs we saved the exact unique counts. This works fine, but
you can't answer queries such as "how many distinct sessions were there during this
one-week period in the past we've thrown away the raw data for?".

With HLLs, this is easy. You can compute distinct IP counts over a time period with the following query:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT hll_cardinality(hll_union_agg(distinct_ip_addresses))
  FROM http_request_1min
  WHERE ingest_time > date_trunc('minute', now()) - '5 minutes'::interval;

You can find more information on HLLs `in the project's GitHub repository
<https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/postgresql-hll>`_.

Unstructured Data with JSONB
----------------------------

Citus works well with Postgres' built-in support for unstructured data types. To
demonstrate this, let's keep track of the number of visitors which came from each country.
Using a semi-structure data type saves you from needing to add a column for every
individual country and ending up with rows that have hundreds of sparsely filled columns.
We have `a blog post
<https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/07/14/choosing-nosql-hstore-json-jsonb/>`_ explaining
which format to use for your semi-structured data. The post recommends JSONB, here we'll
demonstrate how to incorporate JSONB columns into your data model.

First, add the new column to our rollup table:

.. code-block:: sql

  ALTER TABLE http_request_1min ADD COLUMN country_counters JSONB;

Next, include it in the rollups by modifying the rollup function:

your can modify the dashboard query to look like this:
