Managed Service
==================

One of the easiest ways to get started with Citus is to spin up a cluster in
the cloud on Azure. The Citus managed service is available as
`Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/introduction/>`_, formerly known as Hyperscale (Citus) in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

To get started with Citus on Azure, you can take advantage of our `quickstart for Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/quickstart-create-portal>`_ in the Azure docs,
or go straight to the `free trial <https://cosmos.azure.com/try/>`_ on Azure.)
