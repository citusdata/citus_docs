Manual Query Propagation
========================

When the user issues a query, the Citus coordinator partitions it into smaller query fragments where each query fragment can be run independently on a worker shard. This allows Citus to distribute each query across the cluster.

However, the way queries are partitioned into fragments (and which queries are propagated at all) varies by the type of query. In some advanced situations it is useful to manually control this behavior. Citus provides utility functions to propagate SQL to workers, shards, or colocated placements.

Manual query propagation bypasses coordinator logic, locking, and any other consistency checks. These functions are available as a last resort to allow statements which Citus otherwise does not run natively. Use them carefully to avoid data inconsistency and deadlocks.

.. _worker_propagation:

Running on all Workers
----------------------

The least granular level of execution is broadcasting a statement for execution
on all workers. This is useful for viewing properties of entire worker
databases.

.. code-block:: postgresql

  -- List the work_mem setting of each worker database
  SELECT run_command_on_workers($cmd$ SHOW work_mem; $cmd$);

To run on all nodes -- both workers and the coordinator -- use
``run_command_on_all_nodes()``.

.. note::

  This command shouldn't be used to create database objects on the workers, as
  doing so will make it harder to add worker nodes in an automated fashion.

.. note::

  The :code:`run_command_on_workers` function and other manual propagation commands in this section can run only queries which return a single column and single row.

Running on all Shards
---------------------

The next level of granularity is running a command across all shards of a particular distributed table. It can be useful, for instance, in reading the properties of a table directly on workers. Queries run locally on a worker node have full access to metadata such as table statistics.

The :code:`run_command_on_shards` function applies a SQL command to each shard, where the shard name is provided for interpolation in the command. Here is an example of estimating the row count for a distributed table by using the pg_class table on each worker to estimate the number of rows for each shard. Notice the :code:`%s` which will be replaced with each shard's name.

.. code-block:: postgresql

  -- Get the estimated row count for a distributed table by summing the
  -- estimated counts of rows for each shard.
  SELECT sum(result::bigint) AS estimated_count
    FROM run_command_on_shards(
      'my_distributed_table',
      $cmd$
        SELECT reltuples
          FROM pg_class c
          JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n on n.oid=c.relnamespace
         WHERE (n.nspname || '.' || relname)::regclass = '%s'::regclass
           AND n.nspname NOT IN ('citus', 'pg_toast', 'pg_catalog')
      $cmd$
    );


A useful companion to :code:`run_command_on_shards` is :code:`run_command_on_colocated_placements`. It interpolates the names of *two* placements of :ref:`co-located <colocation>` distributed tables into a query. The placement pairs are always chosen to be local to the same worker where full SQL coverage is available. Thus we can use advanced SQL features like triggers to relate the tables:

.. code-block:: postgresql

  -- Suppose we have two distributed tables
  CREATE TABLE little_vals (key int, val int);
  CREATE TABLE big_vals    (key int, val int);
  SELECT create_distributed_table('little_vals', 'key');
  SELECT create_distributed_table('big_vals',    'key');

  -- We want to synchronize them so that every time little_vals
  -- are created, big_vals appear with double the value
  --
  -- First we make a trigger function, which will
  -- take the destination table placement as an argument
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION embiggen() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
      IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        EXECUTE format(
          'INSERT INTO %s (key, val) SELECT ($1).key, ($1).val*2;',
          TG_ARGV[0]
        ) USING NEW;
      END IF;
      RETURN NULL;
    END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  -- Next we relate the co-located tables by the trigger function
  -- on each co-located placement
  SELECT run_command_on_colocated_placements(
    'little_vals',
    'big_vals',
    $cmd$
      CREATE TRIGGER after_insert AFTER INSERT ON %s
        FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE embiggen(%L)
    $cmd$
  );

Limitations
-----------

* There are no safe-guards against deadlock for multi-statement transactions.
* There are no safe-guards against mid-query failures and resulting inconsistencies.
* Query results are cached in memory; these functions can't deal with very big result sets.
* The functions error out early if they cannot connect to a node.
* You can do very bad things!
