SQL Workarounds
===============

Before attempting workarounds consider whether Citus is appropriate for your
situation. Citus' current version works well for :ref:`real-time analytics and
multi-tenant use cases. <when_to_use_citus>`

Citus supports all SQL statements in the multi-tenant use-case. Even in the real-time analytics use-cases, with queries that span across nodes, Citus supports the majority of statements. The few types of unsupported queries are listed in :ref:`unsupported` Many of the unsupported features have workarounds; below are a number of the most useful.

.. _join_local_dist:

JOIN a local and a distributed table
------------------------------------

Attempting to execute a JOIN between a local table "local" and a distributed table "dist" causes an error:

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT * FROM local JOIN dist USING (id);

  /*
  ERROR:  relation local is not distributed
  STATEMENT:  SELECT * FROM local JOIN dist USING (id);
  ERROR:  XX000: relation local is not distributed
  LOCATION:  DistributedTableCacheEntry, metadata_cache.c:711
  */

Although you can't join such tables directly, by wrapping the local table in a subquery or CTE you can make Citus' recursive query planner copy the local table data to worker nodes. By colocating the data this allows the query to proceed.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- either

  SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT * FROM local) AS x
    JOIN dist USING (id);

  -- or

  WITH x AS (SELECT * FROM local)
  SELECT * FROM x
  JOIN dist USING (id);

Remember that the coordinator will send the results in the subquery or CTE to all workers which require it for processing. Thus it's best to either add the most specific filters and limits to the inner query as possible, or else aggregate the table. That reduces the network overhead which such a query can cause. More about this in :ref:`subquery_perf`.

Temp Tables: the Last Resort
----------------------------

There are still a few queries that are :ref:`unsupported <unsupported>` even with the use of push-pull execution via subqueries. One of them is running window functions that partition by a non-distribution column.

Suppose we have a table called :code:`github_events`, distributed by the column :code:`user_id`. Then the following window function will not work:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- this won't work

  SELECT repo_id, org->'id' as org_id, count(*)
    OVER (PARTITION BY repo_id) -- repo_id is not distribution column
    FROM github_events
   WHERE repo_id IN (8514, 15435, 19438, 21692);

There is another trick though. We can pull the relevant information to the coordinator as a temporary table:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- grab the data, minus the aggregate, into a local table

  CREATE TEMP TABLE results AS (
    SELECT repo_id, org->'id' as org_id
      FROM github_events
     WHERE repo_id IN (8514, 15435, 19438, 21692)
  );

  -- now run the aggregate locally

  SELECT repo_id, org_id, count(*)
    OVER (PARTITION BY repo_id)
    FROM results;

Creating a temporary table on the coordinator is a last resort. It is limited by the disk size and CPU of the node.
