SQL Workarounds
===============

Citus supports most, but not all, SQL statements directly. Its SQL support continues to improve. Also many of the unsupported features have workarounds; below are a number of the most useful.

Subqueries
----------

In analytics it is common to model information using a "star schema." This is a collection of dimensional tables (e.g. observations, statistics) referencing a table of facts (e.g. people, pages or events). Furthermore, a common form of query examines dimensions for a subset of the facts. Examples of these kind of queries:

* "Get aggregated statistics about football players whose passes exceed three hundred yards."
* "Which other pages do people visit who view a certain page?"
* "Count the number of distinct sessions for the top twenty-five most visited blog posts."
* "What is the number of people in companies among the top fifty product areas?"

The general form of the query in SQL is

.. code-block:: sql

  select dim_a, dim_b, dim_c
    from dimensions
   where fact_id in (select id from facts where ...conditions...)
     and ...conditions...;

Citus does not allow subqueries in the WHERE clause so we must choose a workaround.

Workaround 1. Generate explicit WHERE-IN expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pros
    * Able to distribute the query across shards
* Cons
    * Constructed query not suitable when facts subquery returns large number of results
    * Somewhat hard to read, requires building custom SQL

In this technique we use PL/pgSQL to construct and execute one statement based on the results of another.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- create temporary table with results
  do language plpgsql $$
    declare facts_array integer[];
  begin 
    execute 'select id from facts where ...conditions...'
       into facts_array;
    execute format(
      'create temp table results_temp as '
      'select dim_a, dim_b, dim_c'
      '  from dimension'
      ' where fact_id = any(array[%s])'
      '   and ...conditions...',
      array_to_string(facts_array, ','));
  end;
  $$;

  -- read results, remove temp table
  select * from results_temp;
  drop table results_temp;

Workaround 1Â½. Build query in SQL client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pros
    * Able to distribute the query across shards
* Cons
    * Constructed query not suitable when facts subquery returns large number of results
    * Requires two query roundtrips to client

Like the previous workaround this one creates an explicit list of values for an IN comparison. The client obtains the list of items with one query, and uses it to construct the second query.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- first run this
  select id from facts where ...conditions...

Interpolate the list of ids into a new query

.. code-block:: sql

  -- notice the explicit list of ids obtained from previous query
  select dim_a, dim_b, dim_c
    from dimensions
   where fact_id in (2,3,5,7,11,13)
     and ...conditions...;

Workaround 2. Duplicate on Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Pros
    * Works for subqueries returning any number of results
* Cons
    * Must transmit full rows from the queries back to the master

In this workaround the client runs the outer- and sub-query independently, saves their results, and joins them.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- Capture the dimension query results
  create temp table dim_temp as
  select fact_id, dim_a, dim_b, dim_c
    from dimensions
   where ...conditions...;
  
  -- Capture the subquery results
  create temp table fact_temp as
  select id
    from facts
   where ...conditions...;
  
  -- Run the query on local tables where subqueries are OK
  select dim_a, dim_b, dim_c
    from dim_temp
   where fact_id in (select id from fact_temp);

  -- Remove temp tables
  drop table dim_temp;
  drop table fact_temp;

INSERT INTO ... SELECT
----------------------

Citus does not support directly inserting the results of a query into a distributed table. One workaround is to use two database connections to stream the query results to master and then distribute them to the shards.

.. code-block:: bash

  psql -c "COPY (query) TO STDOUT" | psql -c "COPY table FROM STDIN"

This does incur network cost. If this workaround is too slow please contact Citus Data support. We can assist you in parallelizing the table insertion across all workers using a more complicated technique.

SELECT DISTINCT
---------------

Citus does not yet support SELECT DISTINCT but you can use GROUP BY for a simple workaround:

.. code-block:: sql

  -- rather than this
  -- select distinct col from table;

  -- use this
  select col from table group by col;

JOIN a local and a distributed table
------------------------------------

Attempting to execute a JOIN between a local and a distributed table causes an error:

::

  ERROR: cannot plan queries that include both regular and partitioned relations

In Citus Community and Enterprise editions there is a workaround. You can replicate the local table to a single shard on every worker and push the join query down to the workers. Suppose we want to join tables *here* and *there*, where *there* is already distributed but *here* is on the master database.

.. code-block:: sql

  -- Allow "here" to be distributed
  -- (presuming a primary key called "here_id")
  SELECT master_create_distributed_table('here', 'here_id', 'hash');

  -- Now make a full copy into a shard on every worker
  SELECT master_create_worker_shards(
    'here', 1,
    (SELECT count(1) from master_get_active_worker_nodes())::integer
  );

Now Citus will accept a join query between *here* and *there*, and each worker will have all the information it needs to work efficiently.

.. note::

  Citus Cloud uses PostgreSQL replication, not Citus replication, so this technique does not work there.
