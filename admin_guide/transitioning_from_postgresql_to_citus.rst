Transitioning From PostgreSQL to Citus
#########################################

As Citus is a PostgreSQL extension, PostgreSQL users can start using Citus by simply installing the extension on their existing PostgreSQL database. Once you create the extension, you can create and use distributed tables through standard PostgreSQL interfaces while maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools. Please look at :ref:`working_with_distributed_tables` for specific instructions.

To move your data from a PostgreSQL table to a distributed table, you can copy
out the data into a csv file and then use the \\copy command to load it into a
distributed table. Alternatively, you could copy out data from the local table and
directly pipe it to a copy into the distributed table. For example:

::

    psql -c "COPY local_table TO STDOUT" | psql -c "COPY distributed_table FROM STDIN"

One thing to note as you transition from a single node to multiple nodes is that you should create your extensions, operators, user defined functions, and custom data types on all nodes.
