Ingesting, Modifying Data (DML)
###############################

The following code snippets use the distributed tables example dataset, see :ref:`ddl`.

Inserting Data
--------------

Single row inserts
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

To insert data into distributed tables, you can use the standard PostgreSQL `INSERT <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-insert.html>`_ commands. As an example, we pick two rows randomly from the Github Archive dataset.

::

    INSERT INTO github_events VALUES (2489373118,'PublicEvent','t',24509048,'{}','{"id": 24509048, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SabinaS/csee6868", "name": "SabinaS/csee6868"}','{"id": 2955009, "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SabinaS", "login": "SabinaS", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2955009?", "gravatar_id": ""}',NULL,'2015-01-01 00:09:13'); 

    INSERT INTO github_events VALUES (2489368389,'WatchEvent','t',28229924,'{"action": "started"}','{"id": 28229924, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/inf0rmer/blanket", "name": "inf0rmer/blanket"}','{"id": 1405427, "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tategakibunko", "login": "tategakibunko", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1405427?", "gravatar_id": ""}',NULL,'2015-01-01 00:00:24'); 

When inserting rows into distributed tables, the distribution column of the row being inserted must be specified. Based on the distribution column, Citus determines the right shard to which the insert should be routed to. Then, the query is forwarded to the right shard, and the remote insert command is executed on all the replicas of that shard.

Bulk loading
$$$$$$$$$$$$

Sometimes, you may want to bulk load several rows together into your distributed tables. To bulk load data from a file, you can directly use `PostgreSQL's \\COPY command <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY>`_.

For example:

::

    \COPY github_events FROM 'github_events-2015-01-01-0.csv' WITH (format CSV)

.. note::

    There is no notion of snapshot isolation across shards, which means that a multi-shard SELECT that runs concurrently with a COPY might see it committed on some shards, but not on others. If the user is storing events data, he may occasionally observe small gaps in recent data. It is up to applications to deal with this if it is a problem (e.g.  exclude the most recent data from queries, or use some lock).

    If COPY fails to open a connection for a shard placement then it behaves in the same way as INSERT, namely to mark the placement(s) as inactive unless there are no more active placements. If any other failure occurs after connecting, the transaction is rolled back and thus no metadata changes are made.

INSERT INTO ... SELECT
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Citus is commonly used to scale out event data pipelines and populate real-time dashboards. Typically users are interested in quickly querying predefined aggregations of incoming data. To speed up their queries, people with high data volumes store pre-aggregated data. This is called "rolling up" the data and it avoids the cost of processing raw data at run-time. Rolling up timeseries data into hourly or daily statistics not only increaes query speed, it can also save space. In some cases old raw data can be deleted after rollup, while new data can be retained in its entirety.

Materialized views are one simple way to accomplish time-interval rollups, but refreshing materialized views requires re-scanning all raw data. A more flexible approach is :code:`INSERT INTO ... SELECT`, whereby the results of a select query are inserted into a table. It allows incremental updates, plus under certain conditions Citus can parallelize execution of the rollup. We'll see more about that later, first some basics.

Single-Shard Updates and Deletion
---------------------------------

You can also update or delete rows from your tables, using the standard PostgreSQL `UPDATE <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-update.html>`_ and `DELETE <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-delete.html>`_ commands.

::

    UPDATE github_events SET org = NULL WHERE repo_id = 24509048;
    DELETE FROM github_events WHERE repo_id = 24509048;

Currently, Citus requires that standard UPDATE or DELETE statements involve exactly one shard. This means commands must include a WHERE qualification on the distribution column that restricts the query to a single shard. Such qualifications usually take the form of an equality clause on the tableâ€™s distribution column. To update or delete across shards see the section below.

Cross-Shard Updates and Deletion
--------------------------------

The most flexible way to modify or delete rows throughout a Citus cluster is the master_modify_multiple_shards command. It takes a regular SQL statement as argument and runs it on all workers:

::

  SELECT master_modify_multiple_shards(
    'DELETE FROM github_events WHERE repo_id IN (24509048, 24509049)');

This uses a two-phase commit to remove or update data safely everywhere. Unlike the standard UPDATE statement, Citus allows it to operate on more than one shard. To learn more about the function, its arguments and its usage, please visit the :ref:`user_defined_functions` section of our documentation.

Maximizing Write Performance
----------------------------

Both INSERT and UPDATE/DELETE statements can be scaled up to around 50,000 queries per second on large machines. However, to achieve this rate, you will need to use many parallel, long-lived connections and consider how to deal with locking. For more information, you can consult the :ref:`scaling_data_ingestion` section of our documentation.
