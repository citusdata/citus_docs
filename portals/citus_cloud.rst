Managed Service
###############

`Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/introduction/>`_ is a fully-managed hosted version of Citus on top of Microsoft Azure. It goes beyond the distributed database functionality of the Citus extension itself, and offers you all the capabilities you would expect from an Azure managed serviceâ€”including automated backups, high availability, read replicas, easy monitoring, private endpoints, encryption, compliance, and more.

Try the `Quickstart for Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/quickstart-create-portal>`_ in the Azure documentation to get up and running with Citus on Azure.
