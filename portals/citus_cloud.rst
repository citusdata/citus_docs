Citus Cloud
###########

Citus Cloud is a fully managed hosted version of Citus Enterprise edition on top of AWS. It goes way beyond the functionality of the Citus extension itself. Cloud does failovers in a way thatâ€™s transparent to the application, elastically scales up and scales out, takes automatic backups for disaster recovery, has monitoring and alarms built in, and provides patches and upgrades with no downtime.

* First you'll want to get an account and :ref:`Provision <cloud_overview>` a database.
* Once a Cloud database is provisioned, read :ref:`connection`  to connect your application and REPL to it.
* Next see how easy it is to :ref:`scale <cloud_scaling>` the database -- both up (bigger hardware) and out (more nodes).
* Citus Cloud has an interesting "time travel" feature called :ref:`cloud_forking`. It'll definitely give you some ideas of new ways to use the database.

When you're comfortable with the topics so far, try diving into the :ref:`reference_topic`.
