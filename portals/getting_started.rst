Getting Started
###############

Welcome to the Citus documentation! Citus is an extension to Postgres that
distributes your data and your queries across a database cluster, to give your
application performance at any scale.

.. note::

  There are 3 big new capabilities in Citus 10 that you should know about:

  * Columnar storage
  * Citus on a single node
  * Open source shard rebalancer

Here are some of the most useful getting started resources in docs:

* :ref:`what_is_citus` - Citus use-cases. Do they match yours?
* :ref:`citus_concepts` - Parts and terminology.
* :ref:`single_node_docker` - Install instructions to try it locally.
* :ref:`multi_tenant_tutorial` / :ref:`real_time_analytics_tutorial` - Short tutorials.
* :ref:`use_cases_topic` - In-depth use-case guides and examples.

On the `Getting Started <https://www.citusdata.com/getting-started/>`_ page on
the Citus website, you can find links to our favorite video demos, plus all of
the recent engineering blog posts about new features and new releases.
