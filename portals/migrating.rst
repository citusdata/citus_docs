Migrating to Citus
##################

If you've found that your existing application matches Citus :ref:`use_cases_topic`, then you're ready to learn how to make the two work together.

* As a reminder and quick overview of use-cases, see :ref:`when_to_use_citus`.
* :ref:`Choosing a distribution column <distributed_data_modeling>` explains how to control the data distribution in a Citus cluster. It's an important topic that applies to all use cases.
* :ref:`Transitioning to Citus <transitioning_mt>` has tons of information, from updating schemas and queries to step-by-step instructions for Rails and Django apps.
* To help get the most performance out of a new application on Citus, check out the tips in :ref:`performance_tuning`, including more about table distribution columns.
* Finally, read :ref:`production_sizing` to help decide the best cluster size for a new application.

If you're migrating to Citus, why not do it the easy way and use :ref:`cloud_topic`?
